# Practicing SQL w/ Isaac D. Tucker-Rasbury via DataLemur
Using this as a space to log and organize my SQL practice using the website [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com). Hope you can learn something from this space as well!

## About this Repository
Being a data analyst means keeping my skills sharp. Herein, I log my SQL queries that I've been practicing while going through the exercises on DataLemur.com, a relatively new website where anyone can practice their SQL. Some of these entries will have a accompanying LinkedIn posts and commentary, and I hope you follow those links and learn a bunch as you read along. Given this site has 50-70 questions and that I am doing these at my leisure, this repository will be updated as I go through them, ie. will be updated over time.

Thanks for visiting my portfolio!
